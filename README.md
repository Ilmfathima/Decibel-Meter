# Decibel-Meter
In sound measurement, decibels (dB) quantify sound intensity relative to a reference level.

For instance, common reference level is standard air pressure 1 Pascal (Pa)

Practically, this reference can vary based on some factors (e.g- microphone sensitivity, calibration).

The formula dB = 20 * log10 (averageVolume / reference) estimates dB based on the average volume received from your microphone.

Note: This provides a simplified view. Real-world applications may require adjustments for accuracy.
